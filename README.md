# 🖱️ Virtual Mouse using OpenCV, MediaPipe & PyAutoGUI

A hand gesture-based virtual mouse that uses your webcam to control the cursor and perform click actions. Built with OpenCV for video input, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and PyAutoGUI for GUI control.

---

## 📜 Project Description

This project allows you to control the mouse pointer using hand gestures captured by a webcam. The system utilizes:
- **OpenCV** for video capture,
- **MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking, and
- **PyAutoGUI** to simulate mouse movements and clicks on the screen.

The goal is to provide a hands-free way of interacting with a computer, making it especially useful for **accessibility purposes** or **touchless interfaces**.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✋ **Hand Gesture Control**: Move the cursor by moving your hand.
- 🖱️ **Click Simulation**: Perform mouse clicks with specific gestures (e.g., thumb + index finger or fist).
- 🎯 **Real-time Tracking**: Efficient and fast hand tracking using MediaPipe.
- 💻 **No Extra Hardware**: Just a webcam and your hand!

🖥️ How It Works
Your webcam captures live video.

MediaPipe detects and tracks hand landmarks in real-time.

Index finger controls the mouse position.

Specific gestures trigger mouse clicks (e.g., thumb + index = left click).
