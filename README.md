# Virtual Mouse using OpenCV, MediaPipe & PyAutoGUI

## üìú Project Description
This project allows you to control the mouse pointer using hand gestures captured by a webcam. The system utilizes **OpenCV** for video capture, **MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking, and **PyAutoGUI** to simulate mouse movements and clicks on the screen. The goal is to provide a hands-free way of interacting with a computer, making it especially useful for accessibility purposes.
# VirtualMouse
A hand gesture-based virtual mouse that uses your webcam to control the cursor and perform click actions. Built with OpenCV for video input, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and PyAutoGUI for GUI control.
